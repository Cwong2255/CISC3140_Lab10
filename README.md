# CISC3140 Lab#10

I decided to create a Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface incorporating HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this lab.
The graphical user interface allows the players to click on an unoccupied spot on the board and place an X or O. The interface
also allows the players to reset the game by clicking on the reset button, which will change colors when hovered over.
The status of which player's turn it is, is updated throughout the game. When there is a winner or a draw, the game will 
automatically prevent further moves from being made and display either a draw or the winner of the current game. The board 
also prevents the user from clicking on an occupied spot indicated by the different mouse pointers.
