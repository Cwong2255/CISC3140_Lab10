# CISC3140_Lab10

I decided to create a Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface incorporating HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this Lab.
The graphical user interface allows the players to reset the game by clicking on the reset button, which will change colors when hovered over.
The status of which player's turn is updated throughout the game. The board prevents the user from clicking on an occupied spot 
indicated by the different mouse pointers.
